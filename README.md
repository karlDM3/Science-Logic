# Science Of Logic

Science Of Logic is a minimalistic web project inspired by scientific curiosity and philosophical thought.

The website displays only emojis on the screen. When a user clicks on an emoji, a quote by Albert Einstein appears.

The design is intentionally simple, dark, and focused — symbolizing the depth and mystery of science.

## 🌌 Project Concept

The emojis represent abstract scientific ideas:

🧠 — Intelligence  
⚛️ — Physics

Each click reveals a meaningful quote from Albert Einstein.
